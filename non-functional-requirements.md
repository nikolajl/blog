Non-functional requirements may typically be found examining the following areas:

- Performance (e.g. latency and throughput)
- Scalability (e.g. data and traffic volumes)
- Availability (e.g. uptime, downtime, scheduled maintenance, 24x7, 99.9%, etc)
- Security (e.g. authentication, authorisation, data confidentiality)
- Maintainability (e.g. flexibility, extendability, testability, monitoring, auditing, recovery/failover)
- Reliability
- Interoperability (e.g. interaction with other systems)
- Legal and regulatory requirements (e.g. data protection act)
- Internationalisation (e.g. different languages)
- Accessibility (e.g. different devices, disabled people>
